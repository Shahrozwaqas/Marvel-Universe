# Marvel Universe

Marvel Universe is a modern, cinematic web application built for Marvel fans who want more than just character names.  
The project focuses on presenting heroes and villains with detailed profiles, including their powers, affiliations, stats, and cinematic appearances.

The application is designed with a dark, immersive UI and smooth animations to give a premium, universe-style feel.  
Users can explore characters, filter and sort them, and save their favorites for later using local storage.

This project is built mainly to practice real-world React patterns, clean UI structuring, and performance-friendly frontend development.
